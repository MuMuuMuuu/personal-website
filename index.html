        <p>Hello! My name is Yinzheng Xiong, and I'm passionate about technology, particularly data analysis and algorithm design.
            Ever since I first learned about machine learning, I've been fascinated by its power to uncover hidden patterns, predict trends, and solve complex problems.
            My journey into data science began with curiosity and quickly grew into a genuine passion.
            I enjoy exploring algorithms and models to turn raw data into meaningful insights, helping organizations make informed decisions.
            Currently, I'm deepening my skills by studying advanced machine learning techniques and actively engaging in practical projects.
            Aside from technology, I also enjoy watching anime and listening to music.
            These hobbies allow me to relax, find inspiration, and explore creative narratives beyond my technical interests.
            Through this website, I hope to showcase my projects, interests, and ongoing learning journey in data science and algorithms.</p>
